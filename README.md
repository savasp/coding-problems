# Algorithmic and data structures problems from leetcode.com and algoexpert.io

These are my solutions to some of the leetcode and algoexpert problems. Each solution comes with xUnit test cases.

The organization of the code is such so to make it easier to submit the solutions to the respective sites for evaluation.

I used .NET Core 6.
```
> dotnet --version
6.0.202
```

To run all the test cases...
```
> dotnet restore
> dotnet test
```
