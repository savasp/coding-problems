# Algorithmic and data structures problems from leetcode.com

These are my solutions to some of the leetcode problems. Each solution comes with xUnit test cases.

The organization of the code is such so to make it easier to submit the solutions to leetcode for evaluation.

I used .NET Core 6.
```
> dotnet --version
6.0.202
```

To run all the test cases...
```
> dotnet restore
> dotnet test
```
